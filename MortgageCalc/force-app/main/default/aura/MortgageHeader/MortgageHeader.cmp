    <p class="text-1">Use our mortgage calculator to estimate your monthly mortgage payment. You can input a different home price, down payment, loan term and interest rate to see how your monthly payment changes.</p>
    <p class="text-2">Our monthly payment estimates are broken down by principal and interest, property taxes and homeowners insurance. We take our calculator a step further by factoring in your credit score range, zip code and HOA fees to give you a more precise payment estimate. Youâ€™ll also go into the home-buying process with a more accurate picture of how to calculate mortgage payments and purchase with confidence. After you run some estimates, read on for more education and home-buying tips.</p>
